<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 21, 2025</p>

<p>By accessing or using the website <a href="https://www.deskflowmobility.co.za">https://www.deskflowmobility.co.za</a> (the “Site”) or any services provided by Desk Flow Mobility (“we,” “us,” or “our”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, please do not use the Site or our services.</p>

<h2>1. Nature of the Service</h2>
<p>Desk Flow Mobility provides guided desk-based mobility exercises, breathing techniques, and gratitude practices delivered via video, audio, email, or live group sessions. These are general wellness and productivity tools and are <strong>not medical advice, physiotherapy, or psychotherapy</strong>.</p>

<h2>2. Health & Liability Disclaimer (IMPORTANT)</h2>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You participate entirely at your own risk.</li>
    <li>You are physically able and have no medical condition that would prevent you from safely performing the suggested movements.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for consulting a doctor or qualified healthcare professional before starting this or any exercise program, especially if you have neck, back, hip, heart, or any other health concerns.</li>
    <li>Desk Flow Mobility, its owners, instructors, and affiliates are not liable for any injury, loss, or damage connected to your use (or misuse) of our content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All videos, audio files, written guides, and other content are protected by copyright and remain the exclusive property of Desk Flow Mobility. You may not copy, share, resell, re-distribute, or create derivative works from our content without written permission.</p>

<h2>4. Payment & Refunds</h2>
<ul>
    <li>All prices are listed in South African Rand (ZAR) or the currency shown at checkout.</li>
    <li>Payments are processed through secure third-party providers (Calendly + Stripe, or similar).</li>
    <li>Fixed-term programs (e.g., 4-week, 3-month, 6-month, or 12-month programs) are commitment-based purchases. When you purchase a fixed-term program you agree to complete the entire duration of the program you selected.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment (whether paid in full upfront or via an approved payment plan) is non-refundable and non-cancellable once the program has started or you have been granted access to the program materials, whichever occurs first.</li>
        <li>No partial or pro-rated refunds will be issued if you choose not to participate or complete the program.</li>
        <li>Early termination or “pausing” of a fixed-term program is not permitted.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Monthly recurring subscriptions</strong> (if any) are separate from fixed-term programs and may be cancelled at any time with no penalty; cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.</li>
    <li>Refunds are only provided where required by applicable consumer law (for example, under South African Consumer Protection Act or equivalent legislation in your jurisdiction). Any statutory refund rights that cannot be excluded remain unaffected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Cancellation</h2>
<p>Fixed-term programs: Cannot be cancelled before the end of the committed term. Your access will automatically expire at the conclusion of the program unless you choose to renew or purchase another program.</p>
<p>Monthly recurring subscriptions: You may cancel at any time by emailing daniel@deskflowmobility.co.za or through your account dashboard (if applicable). Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period; you will retain access until that date. No further charges will be made after cancellation.</p>

<h2>6. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Record or livestream our live sessions without permission</li>
    <li>Share login details or program materials with non-paying individuals</li>
    <li>Use the Site for any unlawful purpose</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Desk Flow Mobility shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues.</p>

<h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa. Any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Service shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of South Africa.</p>
<p>(Note: South African law is respected internationally and this clause is perfectly acceptable to UK and US clients.)</p>

<h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The updated version will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Site or services after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
